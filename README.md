# Instagram Roast Generator

An Express.js-based application that fetches Instagram profile details and generates AI-generated humorous roasts based on the userâ€™s profile picture and details. Built using OpenAI's GPT model for generating witty responses and integrates with a database for storing user information.

## Features
- Fetch Instagram profile details based on username or URL.
- Check if a user already exists in the database.
- Add new users to the database along with their profile data.
- Generate AI-powered roasts using OpenAI's API.
- Store generated roasts in the database for future reference.

## How It Works

1. **Fetch Instagram Details**: The app uses the Instagram API to retrieve profile details (e.g., profile picture URL).
2. **Check User Existence**: It checks the database to see if the user already exists.
3. **Add New User**: If the user doesn't exist, their profile details are added to the database.
4. **Generate Roast**: The profile details are passed to OpenAI's API to generate a humorous roast.
5. **Store Roast**: The generated roast is stored in the database.
